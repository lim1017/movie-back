# Shoppies API

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Run The Server

```sh
npm start
```

## Creating The DB

Use the `psql -U development` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `development` and the password `development`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE scheduler_development;`.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.development` and fill in the necessary PostgreSQL configuration. The `node-postgres` library uses these environment variables by default.

```
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=development
PGDATABASE=movie_development
PGPASSWORD=development
PGPORT=5432
```
